By Daniel Zadva Jnr (Cohort 3 SDC2025 Student - FE/23/7877998)

### Objective

The goal of this project is to create a personal profile webpage using only HTML. This exercise will test your ability to structure a webpage using semantic HTML elements.

### Task Breakdown

1. Create a Header Section Include a title for the page (e.g. "My Profile"). Add a navigation menu with at least three items (e.g., "About Me", "Hobbies", "Contact"). (No links required).
2. Add a Bio Section Write a short bio introducing yourself. Include an image (use a placeholder image if needed).
3. List Hobbies or Interests Create a list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`) of at least three hobbies or interests.
4. Add a Footer Section Include contact details such as an email address or social media handle.

### Requirements

- Use only HTML (no CSS or JavaScript).
- Use semantic elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `footer`).
- Ensure the HTML structure is well-organized and readable.

### How Requirements Were Met

- **Header Section**: The header includes a title and a navigation menu with four items: "About Me", "Hobbies", "Portfolio", and "Contact".
- **Bio Section**: A short bio is provided along with an image of Daniel Zadva Jnr. The image has `alt`, `width`, and `height` attributes for accessibility and to prevent reflow.
- **Hobbies List**: An unordered list (`<ul>`) is used to list three hobbies: Reading, Coding, and Writing.
- **Footer Section**: The footer includes contact details with an email address wrapped in an `<a>` tag with a `mailto:` link, and the physical address is provided. The copyright information is also included.
